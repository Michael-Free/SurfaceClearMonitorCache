# SurfaceClearMonitorCache

This seems to be an issue with Microsoft Surfaces and a lot of dockable laptops.

For some reason duap monitors will just stop working. No amounts of reboots, unplugging, replugging and monitor switching will help.

It amazes me that microsoft is so incapabile of making an OS that works on their own hardware.

Then again... i dont use windows, i just support the poor fools who do.
