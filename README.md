# Microsoft Surface Dual Monitor Fix - Monitor Cache

This seems to be an issue with Microsoft Surfaces and a lot of dockable laptops.

For some reason dual monitors will just stop working. No amounts of reboots, unplugging, replugging and monitor switching will NOT help.

It amazes me that Microsoft is so incapable of making an OS that works on their own hardware.  The only think that seems to work is applying this registry file, which seems to clear the monitor cache.

Then again... I dont use Iindows, I just support these silly fools who do.

It appears to be a well documented issue:
